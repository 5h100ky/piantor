# Piantor

The Piantor Keyboard is a 42-key or 36-key wired, diodeless, non-flippable, low profile choc v1 (hybrid hotswap and non-hotswap/soldered-in), aggressive column staggered, programmable ergonomic mechnical split keyboard powered by Rasyberry Pi Pico or other compatible RP2040 boards. It is based on the Cantor Keyboard. The name "Piantor" is the portmanteau of "Pico" and "Cantor".
